# preface and purpose
This project will look at from a dataset containing information about vehicles and their specifications when listed on a site to be sold. The main purpose of this project is to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service that will be accesible to the public. I will achieve this by using applications such as a CLI (Command Line Interface), VSC (Visual Studio Code), GitHub, and Render. The purpose of this web application would be the ability to simulate random events and occurencess. This is an interactive and visual way to understand code - and possibly make it fun as well!
